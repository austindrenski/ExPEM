# The Extensible Partial Equilibrium Modeling Project

The Extensible Partial Equilibrium Modeling (ExPEM) project aims to create a simple to use, easy to extend, and powerful application for partial equilibrium analysis. 

At the heart of ExPEM lies the [AD.PartialEquilibriumApi](https://github.com/austindrenski/AD.PartialEquilibriumApi)
 (PEA) library. The PEA library defines the ExPEM-type model and how C# programs can extend it to for use in new applications. The ExPEM application will implement the PEA library upon its completion. During development, a console application is maintained [here](https://github.com/austindrenski/AD.PartialEquilibriumApi/tree/master/AD.PartialEquilibriumApi.Example) and demonstrated [here](https://github.com/austindrenski/AD.PartialEquilibriumApi/wiki/Example-Model).
 
The ExPEM application will be available as both a console application and a desktop application. The desktop application will provide full functionality in a graphical setting. The desktop application is intended be user-friendly, if you find that it is not yet meeting this goal, open an issue, submit a pull request, or contact me directly at Austin.Drenski@gmail.com.

This repository will eventually host the end-user application, but during development experimental versions can be previewed here: [AD.PartialEquilibriumApi](https://github.com/austindrenski/AD.PartialEquilibriumApi).
